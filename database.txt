RELATIONSHIPS:

- **One-to-Many Relationship** between `clients` and `properties_shown`:
   - One client can have multiple properties shown to them.
   - The relationship is established via the foreign key `client_id` in the `properties_shown` table, which references the `client_id` in the `clients` table.
   - **Cascade Options**:
     - **ON DELETE CASCADE**: If a client is deleted, all the properties shown to that client will also be deleted.
     - **ON UPDATE CASCADE**: If a client's `client_id` is updated, the related `client_id` in `properties_shown` will automatically update.
