## Novel Feature: Dynamic Data Visualization

### Description:
I integrated **dynamic graphs** that visually represent client and property data, such as:
- The **number of properties shown to clients per state**.
- The **number of clients per city**.

These graphs are generated dynamically using data fetched directly from the database, ensuring real-time accuracy.

### Why I Chose This Feature:
- Visualizing data improves the user experience by presenting data in a more comprehensive way to understand. 
- It enhances decision-making for myself and the real estate team. 
- This feature sets the project apart by showcasing advanced data visualization and dynamic database integration.

### Libraries and Tools Used:
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visual graphs and charts.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and organizing query results.
- **Flask**: To render the graphs dynamically in the application.
- **SQL**: To fetch the latest data from the database.

### How It Enhances the Project:
By dynamically visualizing database data, the application delivers a refined and professional look ensuring users see the latest insights without having to update manually. This dynamic visualizations highlights real-time and updated data to the users, making the application more engaging and informative.
